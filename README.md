## Architecture and Design Pattern

By following an iterative development process, transforming user stories and design mockups into functional components, and utilizing responsive design through Bootstrap, I managed the project's development  effectively.

## Approach

This project revolves around creating a travel site called AirJournal. I completed the majority of bracket 1 on Day 2, which involved wireframing, user stories, and establishing how many models I would use. I have also implemented a header that remains visible across all pages on angular. On Day 6, I finalized the information component on the Home page and started bracket 2 by displaying a list of citites and showing a list of activities associated with that city. On my last day I worked on both ReadMe's, as well as Did 16 straight hours of CSS.I encountered challenges related to getting my test to properly pass. I was determined! I used MockMvc again, even though I am not full comfortable with it. I am growing more comfortable each time I use it.However, by referring to my lesson notes and following the necessary steps, I successfully resolved these challenges.


## User Stories

User should see the NAVBAR from all pages of the site.

Users should be able to view a city.

Users should be able to click to the FAQs page to see answers to a few questions.

On the home page users can browse through 3-4 suggested cities to visit w/ a photo, the name of the country, and city. 

User should have access to all activities.

User should see ads on the home page / or travel tips.



## Wireframes

## Hurdles

- Routing between the different pages - I had a hard time understanding how to set up the routing. Once I looked back through our lesson notes, I was able to create a router and path for each page

- Nesting Routes within the Cities Component 

- Time management.
