## Architecture and Design Pattern

By following an iterative development process, transforming user stories and design mockups into functional components, and utilizing responsive design through Bootstrap, I managed the project's development  effectively.

## Approach

This project revolves around creating a travel site called AirJournal. I completed the majority of bracket 1 on Day 2, which involved wireframing, user stories, and establishing how many models I would use. I have also implemented a header that remains visible across all pages on angular. On Day 6, I finalized the information component on the Home page and started bracket 2 by displaying a list of citites and showing a list of activities associated with that city. On my last day I worked on both ReadMe's, as well as Did 16 straight hours of CSS.I encountered challenges related to getting my test to properly pass. I was determined! I used MockMvc again, even though I am not full comfortable with it. I am growing more comfortable each time I use it.However, by referring to my lesson notes and following the necessary steps, I successfully resolved these challenges.
